Local Library Project
Project Description
Welcome to the Local Library project! In your neighborhood, a local library is being established to facilitate book lending and borrowing among community members. To efficiently organize this initiative, a dashboard is required. This dashboard will serve as a central hub to display information about available books, those currently borrowed, and other relevant statistics to enhance the overall program experience.

While others are handling logistics and design, your role is crucial in developing the algorithms that power the functionality of the dashboard.
